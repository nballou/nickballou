abstract: "Loot boxes are items in video games that may be bought for real-world money but provide randomised rewards. When buying loot boxes, players stake real-world money on the chance outcome of a future event. Formal similarities between loot boxes and gambling have led to concerns that they may provide a ‘gateway’ to gambling. In particular, there are concerns that they may provide a gateway to gambling amongst children."
