Hello! I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London studying the relationship between well-being and video game play. I look at this in terms of both quantity and quality of play.

More specifically, I'm interested in how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs needs might help explain both the positive and negative relationships people can have with video games. My work seeks to support clinicians in understanding dysregulated gaming and its status as a diagnostic category, to provide parents and gamers with strategies that help them to regulate their gaming in a healthy way, and to inform game design that promotes harmonious engagement and the well-being of players.

I am supervised by [Prof Sebastian Deterding](https://codingconduct.cc/Publications), [Dr David Zendle](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/david-zendle(127e6f28-98bb-4662-a759-369391c609e6)/publications.html), and [Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html).

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects, so if any of your interests align with mine, please get in touch! I'd be delighted to speak with you.
