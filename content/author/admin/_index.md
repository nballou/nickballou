Hello! I am an incoming PhD student at Queen Mary, University of London in the area of games user research. I am particularly interested in the effect of game design on satisfaction of the need for autonomy in the game environment, and how this affects both motivation and the broader psychological outcomes of video game playâ€”positive and negative. 

I completed my MPhil at the University of Cambridge in 2018 and my bachelor at Tulane University in 2016. Although my background is in linguistics (L2 phonetics/phonology, specifically), my current interests lie at the intersections of games user research, psychology, mental health, and open science. 

I am actively looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects both in and out of academia. If any of your interests align with mine, please get in touch! I'd be delighted to speak with you.
