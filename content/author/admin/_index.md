Hello! I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. I study need satisfaction and, increasingly, need frustration in video games, and how the combination of game design and individual factors may affect player experience and the effects that games may have on their players. More broadly, I'm interested in how need satisfaction and frustration can be used to explain motivation and both the positive and negative psychological relationships people have with video games.

My goal is to inform game design that promotes harmonious engagement and well-being, as well as develop strategies for individuals to navigate increasingly complex digital ecosystems and hybrid reality in a way that supports mental health. I am actively looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects, so if any of your interests align with mine, please get in touch! I'd be delighted to speak with you.
