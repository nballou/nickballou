I am a recent graduate of the University of Cambridge (MPhil), having previously done my bachelor at the University of Tulane. Although my background is in linguistics (L2 phonetics/phonology, specifically), my current interest is in need satisfaction, motivation, and well-being related to video games. I am actively speaking with a number of researchers in this area, and hope to begin my PhD in 2019 or 2020.
