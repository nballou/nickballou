Hello! I'm a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London studying the relationship between well-being and video game play. I look at this in terms of both quantity and quality of play. How do people use games to address frustrations in their day-to-day life, successfully or not? How do changes in how people are feeling affect gaming behavior, such as playing longer sessions or at different times of day? I hope questions like these can help players/parents, clinicians, and game developers to understand the "active ingredients" of healthy gaming.

I am the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://www.ukrn.org) Local Network Lead at QMUL, and am involved in science reform/open science advocacy and training, as well as meta-scientific research (when I have time).

I am supervised by [Prof Sebastian Deterding](https://codingconduct.cc/Publications), [Dr David Zendle](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/david-zendle(127e6f28-98bb-4662-a759-369391c609e6)/publications.html), and [Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html).

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects, so if any of your interests align with mine, please get in touch! I'd be delighted to speak with you.
