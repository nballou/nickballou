Hello! I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London. I study psychological need satisfaction and, increasingly, need frustration in video games, and how the interaction of game design and individual factors affects player experience and the psychological effects of game use. More broadly, I'm interested in how basic needs can be used to explain both the positive and negative relationships people can have with video games. My goal throughout my research is to inform game design that promotes harmonious engagement and well-being, as well as develop strategies for individuals to navigate increasingly complex digital ecosystems and hybrid reality in a way that supports mental health. 

I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects, so if any of your interests align with mine, please get in touch! I'd be delighted to speak with you.
