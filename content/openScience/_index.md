I have a very strong belief in open research and science reform. To the greatest of my ability, I try to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Here are some examples of things I've done so far to advance open science in my own work and in my research communities:

- Sharing open data, materials, and code in both quantitative (e.g., [this paper](https://osf.io/6gmw2/) on measurement validity of an effectance scale) and qualitative work (e.g., [this paper](https://osf.io/vp7ye/) on compensatory gaming during the covid-19 pandemic)
- Using simulated data for [power analysis](https://osf.io/vp7ye/) of complex models
  - [Simulating synthetic data](https://osf.io/gvdf4/) when ethical barriers prevented sharing of raw data
- Founding and co-organizing the QMUL chapter of [ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org), holding monthly meetings across disciplines and/or institutions about challenges to research quality
- Conducting meta-scientific research on [transparency standards in human-computer interaction journals](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445584)
- Taught workshops on statistical malpractice/"questionable research practices" and publication bias for the [QMUL researcher development programme](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/queenmaryacademy/researcher-development/)
- Writing fully reproducible manuscripts in RMarkdown [e.g., this paper on dysregulated gaming scales](https://osf.io/h9kmv/)
- Publishing open access papers, including applying for exceptional APC funding
- Preregistering both [quantitative and qualitative studies](https://osf.io/6gmw2/)
- Participating in team science/corsortia projects (e.g., [this paper](https://osf.io/xzfa2) by the UK Reproducibility Network, submitted to UK parliament)

I hope this list will continue to grow, and welcome suggestions or collaborations that can help me achieve that!
