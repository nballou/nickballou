I grew up in Hanover, NH, USA with my parents and a Jack Russell terrier. For my undergraduate, I went to Tulane University in New Orleans, a city I’m incredibly grateful to have lived in for four years. After almost but not quite going through with my original plan to design my own major in enigmatology, I took my love of puzzles and applied it to language, graduating with a degree in linguistics and environmental studies in 2016. I then moved to Austria for a year and worked as an au pair for a family with two kids. In 2018, I completed my master in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, where my research involved  phonetics, automated learner assessment, computer-assisted language learning (CALL), and computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT).

The newest step in my journey has taken me to Hong Kong, where I can look at language acquisition from a very different perspective in my role as a primary school English teacher. I’m thoroughly enjoying the new opportunities and constant stimulation available to me in Hong Kong, and am also relishing the challenge of learning a new language and writing system.

In my free time, you can find me watching football (Arsenal), American football (Patriots), baseball (Red Sox), hockey (Bruins), or really whatever sport is on at that time of year. I play some tennis here and there, though not as much as I’d like. My favorite games of all time include The Last of Us, Stardew Valley, and Hearthstone. Most recently, I’ve been playing Horizon: Zero Dawn and Clash Royale.
